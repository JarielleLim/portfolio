                                    <p>Noted is a fictional e-commerce site dedicated to selling unique notebooks at an affordable price. In this project, I got to use my web-design skills and implement it myself, coding the site in html and css. Working
                                        in a group of two, I was in charge of the design and idea of the site, as well as a majority of the coding. I learned a lot working on this, exploring new features such as flexbox, using sass and animations, and
                                        creating responsive websites, not to mention the use of github (and learning how great a repository can be!).

                    <h2>COMING UP WITH THE IDEA</h2>

                    <p>Before any of the coding started and before I teamed up, I needed to have an idea for an e-commerce site. With a Notebook online store in mind, I came up with a general styleguide that would help define the color scheme, font choices,
                        and general styling the site would be going for.</p>

                        <figcaption>branding styleguide made in illustrator</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h2>USERFLOW & WIREFRAMING</h2>
                    <p>After looking through both my partners and my own styleguide, we decided to follow through with the one I created. With the design guide planned, the next step was creating wireframes of the user flow.</p>

                        <div class="imagesorter"> <img src="img/noted/sketches/buyPremade.jpg" alt="buying premade notebooks">

                        <figcaption>branding styleguide made in illustrator</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h2>MAKING GRAPHICS</h2>
                    <p>With the wireframes ready to go, next up was finding images and making the graphics for the site. Using illustrator, I was able to create newsletter images, general graphics and icons for our company.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <div class="imagesorter">
                            <img src="img/noted/eventspic1.jpg" alt="event picture 1">

                        <figcaption>some illustrator graphics for site</figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately for me, HTML and CSS was still fairly new to me, and this meant I had a huge learning curve before I could create the flow and the site I really wanted. Github and using repositories was also another new element to consider
                        (one that I am so glad to be able to have access to). Due to the time constraint and my inexperience, this meant I had to scale down the project requirements in order to give me room to learn. On the bright side, and through the
                        use of the lovely internet, I was able to get a grasp on flexbox, make things responsive/scalable and how to implement finer css details into our site!
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <div class="imagesorter">
                            <img src="img/noted/productpage.jpg" alt="desktop version">
                            <img src="img/noted/productpage-mobile.jpg" alt="mobile version">
                        </div>
                        <figcaption>desktop version(left) and mobile version(right)</figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                    <p>I learned a lot about HTML/CSS and website building in this project, both in terms of the technical skill, and learning how to make a better user experience over-all for the user by making sure the userflow was straight forward and
                        had things like breadcrumbs, interaction feedback and mobile compatibility. After this, I found myself looking forward to the next project--my website! (as you can see here!) This was a great base for me to start from and as you
                        can see, my profile now also includes use of Javascript, flexbox, animations and an accumulation of knowledge and more that I gained from working on this project.
