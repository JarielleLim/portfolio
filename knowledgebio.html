        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>Knowledge.bio is a biology database, online application that allows users to search for concept relations between terminologies. As the only designer working on the website, a majority of my time was spent coming up with new design ideas, improving
            old functionalities and conducting user tests in order to discover any bugs, missing functionalities or general usability issues.</p>

        <p>When I joined the team, I learned I was going to be the first and only designer on the job working with coders who were mainly working back-end. There were a lot of usability issues, from miss-directing links, to un-intuitive buttons as well as
            a confusing navigation system. I was tasked with figuring out those issues, creating a better interface as well as fixing the usability of the site.</p>

        <p>After gathering usability issues and conducting user testing, as well as researching about the best way to deal with hierarchy, I did some visual prototypes on illustrator to showcase possible layouts, color palettes and functions that knowledge.bio
            should be offering.</p>

        <p>I redesigned the logo and created infographics for the website, trying to capture a simple, yet functional aesthetic using flat design. I also documented user experiences and wrote out content for the site as well</p>

        <p>However, an issue I faced was that while I could design the website, implementing it was another issue as the front-end coding was also a co-op student with not too much knowledge on the specific coding style. This led to a lot of design alterations
            to make it more feasible for the front-end coder.</p>
